# Code Samples

Within this repository, you will find excerpts from some of the projects I have worked on in the past years. I started programming in 1996, and have been at it ever since. The intention of these samples is to show the breadth of the work I have done, and highlight various languages and packages I have worked with. 

To me, programming is more of a path than a destination. I strongly feel that being able to learn a new language, either on the fly or within a reasonable expectation of time is mandatory. That said, these examples are in various languages I have meddled with over the years...

Outside of coding, I have many other skills related to managing projects like these. I have strong skills in entrepreneurship and project management, and have formed companies around my software development where I take on many roles from production to promotion. Some things, however, I am clearly better at than others.

Enjoy the samples. There is a brief overview of what each one does at the beginning of the respective files.
